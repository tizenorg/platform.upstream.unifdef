unifdef installation instructions
---------------------------------

Dependencies:
 * unifdef is mostly ANSI C, with a few unixisms
 * unifdefall is a Unix shell script
 * the manual uses the nroff mdoc macros

To build on unix, type `make`. You can adjust the compilation options
using the POSIX standard CFLAGS and LDFLAGS make variables.

To install in your home directory, type `make install`
or to install in /usr type `make prefix=/usr install`.
See the start of the Makefile for the install location
variables.

We assume unix provides the BSD err.h functions and C99 stdbool.h.

The FreeBSD subdirectory has copies of err.c and getopt.c for systems
that don't have them built in. The win32 subdirectory contains build
files for MinGW and Visual Studio 2010 which make use of the FreeBSD
code plus some other portability wrappers.

To build with MinGW, type `mingw32-make -f win32/Makefile.mingw`.
